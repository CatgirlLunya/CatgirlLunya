    <div class="interest">
      over the past few months, i've mostly lost interest in vanilla minecraft, but i've put a few hundred hours(honestly most of my free time) into modpacks. right now i'm playing nomifactory ceu, but i've beaten compact claustrophobia and also played a few others, just not to completion. i mostly enjoy the factory building process, and i enjoy other similar games like shapez. i think i do it because i enjoy the feeling of automation being scaled up over and over, but i also like the perfect feeling 3d environment minecraft gives. i like it so much, in fact, that i'm trying to make a voxel engine in c that would combine performance that minecraft needs with good code practice that i know how to use(but notch clearly didnt) and lua for modding to make a mixture of beta minecraft feeling but also easy extensibility into factory building and automation.

      my free time that hasn't gone into minecraft has gone into celeste, where i play around yellow-red grandmaster rated levels at the hardest, although i may eventually try to aim higher. i very recently finished winter collab 2021, and i've beaten all of spring collab before, including gmhs. i have around 1500 hours in it, but still enjoy playing levels that don't take too long but still give me a challenge. it's taken a really long time to get to the point where i am and i'm pretty happy just playing levels around this difficulty. i have all 202 berries.

      i don't play much super metroid anymore, but i used to put a ton of time into it, and i've probably played over 100 randomizers. although it's a short game(3-6 hour casually, 40 minutes to an hour competitively) the tight movement, music, controls, unique abilities, and story all make it one of my favorite games ever. on top of randomizers(i played at expert level on VARIA on average) which test how well you can do very situational tech depending on what items it places where, i also speedran alot, getting a 41 minute in game time i believe as my best. maybe not very good, but placing in the top 50% of a really competitive game as a 15 year old made me pretty satisfied. one day i may come back now that i'm actually good at video games but who knows.

      math | updated 9/15/2024
    </h2>
    <div class="interest">
      i've always really loved math, but for the past 2 years or so i've been spending some of my spare time researching or doing math instead of coding in my productive time. i watch youtubers like michael penn, blackpenredpen, prime newtons, and a few others for math videos that give interesting problems. i also self study through my small textbook collection and pdfs of other books i find online. i love my ipad with goodnotes for this, it makes me feel so much more productive and portable with my learning and makes math so much easier to actually do. right now i'm studying real analysis, but i feel also drawn to number theory, measure theory, probability, and a few other fields. i think im drawn to math because to me, it's the programming language of the universe, which just feels natural to study after studying programming languages of computers. if i want to learn something scientific that matters outside of the digital world, i feel like math and physics are the best two things to study after learning coding so well.

      physics | updated 9/15/2024
    </h2>
    <div class="interest">
      physics feels like the program written in math to me, but with all of its weird quirks its also something that needs to be studied. science isn't purely rational after all, and the evidence often contradicts mathematical logic or is needed to supplant mathematical logic. i also feel like physics is the lowest level science and the most intuitive, while chemistry feels like applied physics and makes little sense to me outside of physical chemistry with how many exceptions to general rules there are. i've only taken one physics class formally, but i self study through textbooks i own(notably, i'm studying quantum mechanics through griffith's 3rd edition introduction to quantum mechanics.

      history/politics | updated 9/15/2024
    </h2>
    <div class="interest">
      studying politics feels necessary both to me as a trans woman living in the united states and as an academic. as a trans woman, its important for me to be aware of the current political climate but more importantly what support is effective, how to support myself, how not to support myself, how to spot people trying to use my identity for credibility(such as neoliberal queer rights proponents), etc. as an academic, i feel too limited in just knowing math and physics, which are largely inapplicable to most people today besides the products they use. i think politics is far more practical to study, and gives me more purpose in the world. also, politics(notably marxist political theory) is far more scientific than the general public is informed of, and so i want to study the science of politics to find for myself what i believe in, agree with, and what works best for everyone. i have more about this in <i>philosophy</i> and <i>quotes</i>, but i mostly read marxist literature such as marx(obviously), engels, lenin, stalin, mao, but some others such as angela davis, web dubois, etc.

      programming
    </h2>
    <div class="interest">
      i've been programming since i was 10 or so, and it was my first academic interest. i started with javascript, moved to python around 11, moved to java at 12, learned opengl, moved to c++ at 14 then c soon after, and i've stuck with that since. i've written several rendering engines in opengl and vulkan, used sdl and sfml for 2d games and applications, worked with imgui in c#, coded this website in html, css, and js, made a bootloader(the part of your computer that runs before your operating system but after the bios, basically the first user-written code), and now i'm working on a lua modable voxel engine in c, aiming to make it similar to beta minecraft but extensible, kindof like minetest but less abstract.
